This Matlab/Octave library was developed during my doctoral research in the [Communication Acoustics Research Group] (https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-signal-processing-and-acoustics/communication-acoustics-spatial-sound-and), Aalto University, Finland. If you would like to reference the code, you can refer to my dissertation published [here](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/22499):
